This is the code I'm using for my Laboratory-3 course (I just need to analyse some data using [Root](root.cern)).
It's quite bad for now and I warmly recommend to check whether everything is fine before running it.

The first laboratory test (here "prova1") is about measuring voltage and current and find values for reverse bias saturation current and thermal voltage in [Shockley diode equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley_diode_equation). I had to repeat the experiment with both Si and Ge diodes.

The second laboratory test (here "prova2") is about measuring exit characteristic for a BJT 2N3906(BU) (Si P-N-P) transistor in common emitter configuration and find values for [Early voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_effect), exit resistance (slope of the curve in the active region) current gain $\beta$, and exit electric conductance. To find values of current gain I repeated the exeperiment with different values of base current ($100 \mu A$ and $200 \mu A$).
