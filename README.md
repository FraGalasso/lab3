This is the code I'm using for my Laboratory-3 course (I just need to analyse some data using [Root](root.cern)).
It's quite bad for now and I warmly recommend to check whether everything is fine before running it.

The first laboratory test (here "prima prova") is about measuring voltage and current and find values for reverse bias saturation current and thermal voltage in [Shockley diode equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley_diode_equation). I had to repeat the experiment with both Si and Ge diodes.
